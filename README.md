I work hands-on with **Linux**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes** and **Azure**

## 🚀 Things I’ve Built

### 🧠 Homelab

I’ve recently started exploring **Kubernetes**, as one of my main long-term projects is to build:

While my current focus is **Containerization** and **Kubernetes**, I also built a small Azure project:
