# Ilyas El-Hallaoui

DevOps Engineer in training • Dual Business Informatics Student • Linux & Cloud enthusiast  
I learn by doing — I **touch it, break it, fix it, and ship it.**

### I’m the next generation of DevOps learners.

I’m 19 years old and part of the dual study program at **Sky-E Red GmbH** while studying **Business Informatics at WBH**.  
Every repo here reflects my learning philosophy: **practice > theory**, automation over repetition, and clarity over complexity.

## ⚙️ How I Work

- **Practice first:** every commit is hands-on.  
- **Tight loops:** small, testable steps > big mystery merges.  
- **Readable by default:** clear READMEs and self-explaining code.  
- **AI as feedback:** never for solutions — only for understanding and refinement.
