I work hands-on with **Linux**, **Python**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes** and **Azure**

Currently, I’m pursuing a dual degree in **Business Informatics** while working as a **DevOps Engineer & IT Consultant** at **Sky-E Red GmbH**.

I love this field because it never stands still and there’s always something new to build and learn.

## 🚀 Things I’ve Built

### 🧠 lab

Whenever I learn new technologies, I try to build and fail instead of read and watch. This is where my lab repo comes in handy. In this repo, I have a ton of projects, files unfinished and finished I did, not to build complete projects but just to learn and understand different technologies:

###  Homelab

I’ve recently started exploring **Kubernetes**, as one of my main long-term projects is to build:

> My personal self-hosted Kubernetes cluster — managed with **FluxCD**, **Helm**, and **GitOps** principles.

I’m currently working through a Kubernetes course to master the fundamentals before starting the full setup.

### 👾 Pacman App (Docker-Compose Project)

A containerized **Node.js + MongoDB** application demonstrating:

- Docker networking  
- Docker Compose

➡️ *[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ilyaselhallaoui/lab/tree/main/Docker-Compose/PacmanMaster#)*

I am currently enhancing the project, to make it a complete web app using Kubernetes, CI/CD and IaC. To view the progess go here:

## ☁️ Microsoft Azure

I’m going all-in on the **Azure ecosystem**.  
Previously, I worked with **AWS** while earning my **AWS CCP (2024)**, but Azure simply felt more exciting and aligned with my DevOps path.

While my current focus is **Containerization** and **Kubernetes**, I also built a small Azure project:

### **Cloud Resume Challenge**
